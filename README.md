## Usage Overview

All commands that access journal data require authentication. You will be prompted for your username and password at the start of your session.

### Common Commands

- `add`             Add a new journal entry (requires authentication)
- `list`            List your journal entries (requires authentication)
- `update`          Update an entry (requires authentication)
- `view`            View a specific entry (requires authentication)
- `delete`          Delete an entry (moves to recycle bin, requires authentication)
- `tags`            List your tags and usage counts (requires authentication)
- `search`          Search your entries (requires authentication)
- `recycle-bin`     List your recycle bin (requires authentication)
- `recover`         Recover an entry from the recycle bin (requires authentication)
- `purge-recyclebin` Purge entries older than 30 days from recycle bin (requires authentication)
- `register-user`   Register a new user
- `clean-legacy`    Remove all legacy/unowned data from the database
- `change-password` Change your password and re-encrypt your data

### Security
- All journal, tag, and recycle bin data is encrypted per user and only accessible after authentication.
- Passwords are hashed and salted using Argon2.
- Each user can only access their own entries, tags, and recycle bin.
- Password changes re-encrypt all your data with your new password.
- Use `clean-legacy` to remove all data not owned by a user.

### Examples
```sh
# Register a new user
cargo run --release -- register-user

# Add a new journal entry
cargo run --release -- add "My first journal entry" --tags personal --due 2025-05-01 --status "In Progress"

# List all entries
cargo run --release -- list

# Change your password
cargo run --release -- change-password

# Clean up legacy data
cargo run --release -- clean-legacy
```
